# hello-world
learn how to use github  
I'm just an college student. What I'm doing is just let my mind "out" like water although my English is bad.  
I don't want to talk too much, becauuse I still have so much things to learn like Englinsh and calculus .etc .  
That's it .   
A start of my github and a part of my coding live.  
The modele of the words are so hard for me to read.  
I had just know that the "Markdown" can be used in github.  
That's so good for me because I had some experiece of use "Markdown" to make note.
And I learned how to make a "new line".
