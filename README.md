learn how to use github
I'm just an college student. What I'm doing is just let my mind "out" like water although my English is bad.
I don't want to talk too much, becauuse I still have so much things to learn like Englinsh and calcus .etc .
That's it . 
A start of my github and a part of my coding live.
The modele of the words are so hard for me to read.
